The pictures were very accurate, so they were no surprises there. This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning. Can I use this?, do you mind if we eat that?, in any case as I said Jon was always very responsive despite being away in the busiest annual holiday of the year.","rate":{"Cleanliness":3.3,"Communication":4.1,"CheckIn":3.3,"Accuracy":4.4,"Location":4.4,"Value":4.4}},{"at":"2016-08-09T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3405e36c59e6164fb67a","fullname":"Marc","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/7935714?set=set1","id":"7935714"},"txt":"Overall a terrific experience.

St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe.

It was great to have the space to relax at home when it was raining and to have access to two bathrooms. The location is wonderful, with lots of great hole-in-the-wall restaurants nearby (which offer some relief from Hong Kong's crazy prices!). If you stay here, be sure to check out Dim Dim Sum and the Biang Biang noodles at Yau Yuen Siu Tsui (a michelin guide restaurant just across the street from the apartment)-- the best noodles I've ever eaten. \n\nThe apartment is small but nicely furnished. Very clean. One thing to note is that the small kitchen has a stovetop and microwave, but no oven. Perfect for cooking a simple breakfast, but not really set up to cook an elaborate meal.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this apartment as a great place to stay in Hong Kong, especially if you're looking for a less touristy location.
