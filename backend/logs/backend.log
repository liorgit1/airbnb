The pictures were very accurate, so they were no surprises there. This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning. Can I use this?, do you mind if we eat that?, in any case as I said Jon was always very responsive despite being away in the busiest annual holiday of the year.","rate":{"Cleanliness":3.3,"Communication":4.1,"CheckIn":3.3,"Accuracy":4.4,"Location":4.4,"Value":4.4}},{"at":"2016-08-09T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3405e36c59e6164fb67a","fullname":"Marc","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/7935714?set=set1","id":"7935714"},"txt":"Overall a terrific experience.

I didn’t have a chance to wander around but as far as I know restaurants, convenient stores or even hospital are all downstairs and IFC (the usual working place) is just 5-10min taxi away. I’ve had some terrible experience staying at Airbnb HK previously and switched back to the boring 5 star hotel mode since then.

(Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice.","rate":{"Cleanliness":3.9,"Communication":4.6,"CheckIn":4.5,"Accuracy":3.8,"Location":3.4,"Value":3.3}},{"at":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbad5","fullname":"Mistie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/1795764?set=set1","id":"1795764"},"txt":"Orestes was a great host!

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

You simply cannot beat the location!  Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.","rate":{"Cleanliness":4.2,"Communication":3.1,"CheckIn":4.5,"Accuracy":4.6,"Location":4.3,"Value":3.5}},{"at":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1ce","fullname":"Vy","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/175750558?set=set1","id":"175750558"},"txt":"We had an amazing time.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal.

We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.

The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal.

We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.

The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)","rate":{"Cleanliness":4.7,"Communication":3.4,"CheckIn":4.6,"Accuracy":3,"Location":4.2,"Value":3.4}},{"at":"2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164faf46","fullname":"Julie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/22888892?set=set1","id":"22888892"},"txt":"Overall this is a great place to stay, walking distance to many casual restaurants and beautiful beach perfect for kids/toddlers. The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.","rate":{"Cleanliness":4.2,"Communication":3.1,"CheckIn":4.5,"Accuracy":4.6,"Location":4.3,"Value":3.5}},{"at":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1ce","fullname":"Vy","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/175750558?set=set1","id":"175750558"},"txt":"We had an amazing time.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)","rate":{"Cleanliness":4.7,"Communication":3.4,"CheckIn":4.6,"Accuracy":3,"Location":4.2,"Value":3.4}},{"at":"2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164faf46","fullname":"Julie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/22888892?set=set1","id":"22888892"},"txt":"Overall this is a great place to stay, walking distance to many casual restaurants and beautiful beach perfect for kids/toddlers. The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.","rate":{"Cleanliness":4.2,"Communication":3.1,"CheckIn":4.5,"Accuracy":4.6,"Location":4.3,"Value":3.5}},{"at":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1ce","fullname":"Vy","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/175750558?set=set1","id":"175750558"},"txt":"We had an amazing time.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends.

Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice.","rate":{"Cleanliness":3.9,"Communication":4.6,"CheckIn":4.5,"Accuracy":3.8,"Location":3.4,"Value":3.3}},{"at":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbad5","fullname":"Mistie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/1795764?set=set1","id":"1795764"},"txt":"Orestes was a great host!

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted.

The listing description was accurate enough, with respect to the way the apartment looks. If you can't deal with noise at night, however, this might not be the place for you. The neighbors were surprisingly noisy in the wee hours of the night and virtually silent during the day. This apartment is close to the subway, which was very useful.","rate":{"Cleanliness":4.4,"Communication":4.2,"CheckIn":3.9,"Accuracy":4.1,"Location":4.6,"Value":3.9}},{"at":"2016-04-23T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3407e36c59e6164fbdca","fullname":"Jaime","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/37244180?set=set1","id":"37244180"},"txt":"Kevin was very helpful and communicative during the whole time.

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful.

Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends.
