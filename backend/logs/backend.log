This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning.

Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon).
